# Multi-Vehicle Search Take-Home Challenge

## Prompt

We'd like you to write a search algorithm that will allow renters to find locations where they could store multiple vehicles. Please write and deploy and endpoint that:

1. Accepts a request like:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://your-api.com/" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '[
               {
                   "length": 10,
                   "quantity": 1
               },
               {
                   "length": 20,
                   "quantity": 2
               },
               {
                   "length": 25,
                   "quantity": 1
               }
           ]'
   ```

   Each item in the request array represents vehicles that needs to be stored. The `length` is the length of the vehicle in feet. You can assume that the `width` of each vehicle is 10 feet. The `quantity` is how many vehicles of those dimensions need to be stored.

   The sum of all `quantity` values will always be less than or equal to 5.

1. Searches through the array of listings provided in the attached `listings.json` file. Where each listing looks like:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "abc123",
     "length": 10,
     "width": 20,
     "location_id": "def456",
     "price_in_cents": 100
   }
   ```

   All `length` and `width` values are multiples of 10.

1. And returns a response like:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "location_id": 1,
       "listing_ids": [1, 2, 3],
       "total_price_in_cents": 300
     },
     {
       "location_id": 2,
       "listing_ids": [4, 5],
       "total_price_in_cents": 305
     }
   ]
   ```
   The results should:
   1. Include every possible location that could store all requested vehicles
   1. Include the cheapest possible combination of listings per location
   1. Include only one result per location_id
   1. Be sorted by the total price in cents, ascending
